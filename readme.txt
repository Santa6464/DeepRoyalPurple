Pokémon Deep Royal Purple
- Created by members of the Cici's Pizza Discord

Description: This fanmade game started off as a Christmas present from Claire to Collin after many years of nuzlocking various pokemon games. This new game is intended to be the  game that we nuzlocke moving forward. It is meant to be both challenging and fun, having many difficult fights, but also including many people from our lives that appear throughout the game.

The intent of this document is to list all out all major details of this game, mostly to help with the creation and completion of this rendition.
- YOU DON'T NEED TO READ THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT. Find out what sections you want to help with and then look up Thundaga's tutorial videos on how to make a Pokemon game.

Resources -
1. This game is built from the Pokémon Essentials (PE) by Flameguru, Poccil, Maruno and more. which is a collection of gameplay-altering original code designed for use in an RPG Maker XP game.
	a. The game is built in RPG Maker XP.
	b. The game pulls most data and files from PE Ver. 21.1. This includes everything necessary to build a fully functional Pokémon game, from tilesets to script to Pokémon Gens 1-5.
	c. The game pulls all of its pokemon sprites, abilities, items and move data from Project Gen 9 by Manurocker95, which is built from PE Ver 20.1. Project Gen 9 is an update to PE Ver 20.1 to include all Pokémon up through Generation 9, not including DLCs (it does include prereleased DLC Pokémon such as Walking Wake and Iron Leaves).
	d. This game is based off of Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green. 
	e. Many tilesets are also a fanmade recreation of Johto tilesets, but updated for gen 3, made by metalflygon08.
2. Many custom sprites exist which were created by Claire. These are predominantly trainer sprites, fights and main characters such as Claire, Kalvin, Collin, Corey, Max.
==================================================================================================
Plot - 

	Collin/Claire go get a Pokémon, either Cyndaquil, Rowlet or Piplup... (most of the plot is not created yet)

	...

	Once we get to the second village, people complain of a noise we hear from a nearby haunted house. We go north to route 2 to find the haunted house. Inside we find Kalvin, our rival, who challenges us to a Pokémon battle. We swiftly kick her ass (mark flag for access to route 3) and head back to the village. From there we head East onto Route 3 to Starry Night Village, where we find our first Gym Leader, Celina.

	...

	We fight our way up Victory Road, fight the elite four and beat the Champion, Kalvin, our rival throughout the game. After we swiftly kick her ass, we become the champion.

==================================================================================================
Wild Encounters
	This section will be used to outline wild encounters for each route/town. This may include their encounter rates and levels. The map design has been made to make every possible encounter type in a route/town to be usable, even if another catch has been made of a different encounter type. For example you can do a wild encounter and a headbutt encounter, or a fishing and surfing encounter, but not 2 fishing encounters.

There are three types of encounters
- Wild Encounters (this includes surfing)
- Headbutt Encounters
- Fishing Encounters

Of these three encounters, wild encounters are fully fleshed out, but headbutt encounters and fishing encounters will depend on map design.

No work has been done on what mons will be where
